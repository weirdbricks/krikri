## 📋 What this is

Crystal Ansible parses and runs **standard Ansible playbook YAML directly** -
the same syntax you already write, unmodified. There's no Python, no
`ansible-core`, no `pip`, and no collections directory anywhere in the
picture, on either the controller or the target - it's one compiled binary
(`crystal-ansible`) plus a directory of small compiled module binaries.

It is not a new automation DSL you have to learn, and not a "mostly
compatible" reimplementation verified by eyeballing docs - every plugin's
behavior is checked against real `ansible-playbook` output on real hosts
(see **Differences** and **What's missing** below), and a Docker-based
compatibility harness (`compat/`) runs the same playbooks through both
engines side by side and diffs the resulting state.

---

## 🔀 How this differs from real (Python) Ansible

If you already know Ansible, here's what actually changes when you swap
`ansible-playbook` for `./bin/crystal-ansible`:

### Architecture: compiled binaries, not a Python interpreter per task

Real Ansible ships a Python module's source, templates it, and starts a
fresh Python interpreter for it on the target host **for every single
task**, every run - even when nothing changes. Crystal Ansible compiles
each module (`apt`, `copy`, `service`, ...) into its own small native
binary once; running a task means uploading that binary (cached after the
first run) and executing it directly - no interpreter startup, no module
templating step, no `AnsiballZ` wrapper. Consecutive tasks bound for the
same host are also batched into a single SSH round trip by default
(`--no-batching` to disable) instead of one round trip per task.

This is the single biggest practical difference, and it shows up directly
in wall-clock time - see **Performance** below.

### What's the same

Playbook syntax, inventory format, `roles/` layout, Jinja2 templating
(filters, tests, block tags), `become:`, Vault, `--check`/`--diff`,
`--tags`/`--limit`, handlers, loops, `block:`/`rescue:`/`always:` - all
parsed and executed the same way, from the same YAML files you already
have. See **Features** below for the full list of what's implemented.

### What's structurally different (by design, not a gap)

- **No arbitrary Python execution.** A role's own private `library/*.py`
  module (outside the `ansible.builtin`/`community.*` set this project
  ships as native binaries) can't run - there's no Python interpreter to
  run it in. The task is skipped with a warning rather than crashing the
  play, but anything downstream depending on its result sees an undefined
  value.
- **Cloud provider modules and inventory plugins are out of scope for
  now** - `amazon.aws`/`community.aws` (`ec2_instance`, `s3_object`, IAM,
  security groups, ...), `azure_rm_*`, and dynamic cloud inventory
  plugins (`aws_ec2.yml` etc.) aren't implemented. These are a
  fundamentally different kind of module (HTTP calls to a cloud API from
  the controller, not shell commands run on a managed target) and would
  need a real API client built from scratch - a much bigger undertaking
  than adding another module that shells out to a CLI tool. Not planned
  unless a specific real-world need justifies the investment.
- **`docker_*`'s `api_version:` pin isn't supported** - the underlying
  Docker client talks unversioned API endpoints throughout, which
  negotiate fine against current Docker/Podman, but pinning a specific
  API version would mean touching every endpoint individually.
- **`meta:` supports `clear_facts`/`flush_handlers`/`end_host`/
  `end_play`/`clear_host_errors`/`noop`/`refresh_inventory`** -
  `reset_connection`/`end_batch`/`end_role` still act on execution-flow
  machinery this engine models differently (persistent-connection
  control, `serial:` batching, and role-scoped early-return
  respectively), and are rejected at parse time rather than silently
  accepted and ignored.

---

## ❓ What's missing

**Short version: as of this version, there are no known real correctness
gaps left open** - the primary way gaps get found here is running real
production Ansible roles (from Galaxy) against both engines on real
hosts and diffing the result, not a pre-planned feature checklist, and
every gap found that way has been fixed. The structural differences
above are the only *deliberate* exclusions.

That status changes as new roles get tested, so it's tracked in one place
rather than duplicated here:

- **[KNOWN_MISSING.md](KNOWN_MISSING.md)** - the current, short,
  up-to-date list of any open real gaps plus the full explicit scope-cut
  list (cloud modules, role-private modules, a handful of untestable/
  narrow module gaps, etc., each with the reasoning behind it).
- **[ROLES_TESTED.md](ROLES_TESTED.md)** - the current status of every
  real Ansible Galaxy role that's been benchmarked against a live host,
  one line each, so you can check whether something resembling your own
  playbooks has already been exercised.

Both files describe **current state only** - the fix history for
everything already resolved lives in `git log`, not duplicated in either
file (searchable, e.g. `git log --all --grep=auth_socket`).

---

## ⚡ Performance

Native compiled modules, one persistent SSH connection per host, and
batched round trips make the biggest difference on **idempotent
re-runs** - the common case for a config-management tool running on a
schedule, where most tasks find nothing to change but Python still pays
a fresh interpreter-and-module cost per task regardless.

Measured against real `ansible-playbook` (`ansible-core` 2.19.4): 10
real Galaxy roles drawn at random from the project's verified-clean
list, each on its own **fresh** Atlantic.net `G3.2GB` Ubuntu-22.04 host
pair (one host per engine, never reused, destroyed immediately after),
cold (first touch) and warm (idempotent re-run) on both engines,
`--forks 1` on both sides. crystal-ansible was built `--release` and
stripped, and ran with `--persistent-daemon --no-batching` (one
long-lived `ssh ... -- <plugin binary> --daemon` connection per host
instead of a fresh `ssh`+`bash`+exec per task; batching is disabled
during measurement because it routes around that path). `PLAY RECAP`
parity with real Ansible (`ok=`/`changed=`/`failed=`/`skipped=`) was
checked per role, cold AND warm, and matched exactly on all 10:

| Role (author) | Python cold | Crystal cold | Cold speedup | Python warm | Crystal warm | Warm speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `robertdebock.remi` | 4.39s | 3.55s | 1.2x | 2.82s | **0.72s** | **3.9x** |
| `geerlingguy.helm` | 27.28s | **9.74s** | **2.8x** | 5.81s | **1.66s** | **3.5x** |
| `geerlingguy.clamav` | 74.15s | **52.19s** | 1.4x | 29.53s | **2.49s** | **11.9x** |
| `geerlingguy.node_exporter` | 54.64s | **8.16s** | **6.7x** | 19.56s | **2.32s** | **8.4x** |
| `robertdebock.types` | 5.34s | 3.34s | 1.6x | 3.15s | **0.65s** | **4.8x** |
| `robertdebock.docker_ce` | 81.13s | **50.45s** | 1.6x | 15.56s | **2.54s** | **6.1x** |
| `robertdebock.digitalocean_agent` | 37.22s | **23.29s** | 1.6x | 17.60s | **2.37s** | **7.4x** |
| `geerlingguy.adminer` | 15.79s | **9.50s** | 1.7x | 9.00s | **2.01s** | **4.5x** |
| `robertdebock.upgrade` | 9.24s | **4.84s** | 1.9x | 6.90s | **1.59s** | **4.3x** |
| `robertdebock.fail2ban` | 39.62s | **21.63s** | 1.8x | 22.33s | **2.65s** | **8.4x** |

Cold runs are dominated by real apt/download time (both engines wait on
the same mirrors), so the trustworthy signal is the warm column:
crystal warm runs are **3.5x-11.9x faster (mean ~6.3x)**, cold runs
1.2x-6.7x faster (mean ~2.2x). Real Ansible pays a fresh Python-
interpreter-and-module cost per task on every run regardless of whether
anything changes; crystal-ansible's compiled-binary-plus-persistent-
connection model is why its warm numbers drop so far below its own
cold.

- ✅ Inventory: static INI + YAML, and dynamic (script-based) inventory
- ✅ SSH connection pooling, plus local (`ansible_connection: local`) execution
- ✅ Variable substitution `{{ vars }}` with a Jinja2 filter pipeline
  (chained filters, e.g. `{{ x | sort | join(',') }}`)

  dotted attribute access), including magic variables such as
  `inventory_hostname` in *bare* (non-`{{ }}`) conditions

- ✅ `--tags` and `--limit` host/task filtering
- ✅ Task batching - consecutive independent tasks bound for the same
  remote host run in a single SSH round trip instead of one round trip
  per task, on by default (`--no-batching` to disable)

# Install dependencies
shards install

# Build (all plugins + the CLI)
./build.sh

# Run a playbook
./bin/crystal-ansible playbook.yml

## 💡 Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Deploy app
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      notify: reload nginx

  handlers:
    - name: reload nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: reloaded
```

Supports standard Ansible playbook syntax. See the
[Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) for playbook reference.

---

## 🎯 Command Reference

```bash
# Basic usage
./bin/crystal-ansible playbook.yml

# With inventory
./bin/crystal-ansible -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Dry-run (check mode)
./bin/crystal-ansible --check playbook.yml

# Show changes
./bin/crystal-ansible --diff playbook.yml

# Verbose output
./bin/crystal-ansible -v playbook.yml

# Limit to a host group/pattern, run only tagged tasks
./bin/crystal-ansible -l webservers -t deploy playbook.yml

# Vault-encrypted playbook/vars
./bin/crystal-ansible --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml
./bin/crystal-ansible --vault-password-file pass.txt playbook.yml

# Disable task batching (on by default - see Performance above)
./bin/crystal-ansible --no-batching -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Run each task against up to 10 hosts concurrently (default: 5, matching
# ansible-playbook; --forks 1 restores one-host-at-a-time)
./bin/crystal-ansible --forks 10 -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Fact gathering policy (default: implicit, matching ansible-playbook):
#   implicit - every play re-gathers
#   explicit - only plays that set gather_facts: true
#   smart    - each host gathered at most once per run
# Under smart, add `meta: clear_facts` to a play (e.g. after a reboot or a
# package install) to force the next play to gather again.
./bin/crystal-ansible --gathering smart -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Multiple options
./bin/crystal-ansible --check --diff -i production.ini playbook.yml
```

### Ad-hoc commands (`ansible`)

A separate binary, matching real Ansible's own `ansible`/`ansible-playbook`
split - runs exactly one module against a pattern of inventory hosts,
reusing the same connection/become/check-mode/forks engine as the
playbook runner:

```bash
./bin/ansible all -m ping
./bin/ansible webservers -a 'uptime'
./bin/ansible all -m command -a 'systemctl status nginx'
./bin/ansible all -m copy -a 'src=foo.conf dest=/etc/foo.conf' -b
./bin/ansible db -i inventory.ini -m service -a 'name=postgresql state=restarted' -b
```

Supports `-i`, `-m`, `-a`, `-u`, `-b`/`--become`, `--become-user`, `-C`/`--check`,
`-f`/`--forks`, `-l`/`--limit`, `-v`. Output matches real ansible's own
minimal callback (`host | SUCCESS => {...}` / `host | CHANGED | rc=0 >>`),
not ansible-playbook's `ok: [host]` TASK-recap style.

---

## ✅ Testing

```bash
# Unit + integration specs (crystal spec's own test runner)
crystal spec

# Ansible compatibility harness - runs the same playbooks through real
# ansible-playbook and crystal-ansible side by side and diffs the result
crystal run compat/run.cr
```

See [compat/README.md](compat/README.md) for what the compatibility
harness covers and how it works.

## 🕐 Recent changes

A short rolling summary of the last few versions - see `git log` for the
complete history (150+ rounds of real-host benchmarking) and
[KNOWN_MISSING.md](KNOWN_MISSING.md)/[ROLES_TESTED.md](ROLES_TESTED.md)
for current-state detail.

- **`0.9.522`** - fixed another missing magic var found benchmarking 20
  new `geerlingguy.*` roles on Ubuntu 22.04 (round 164): `ansible_check_
  mode` (true under `--check`, false on a real run) was entirely
  unimplemented - same class as `ansible_version` below. Also fixed a
  benchmark-harness gap (not a crystal bug): real ansible-core 2.19's
  own stricter `when:` conditional enforcement (rejects any non-boolean
  result, even a common bare-truthy-variable check) needed its
  documented `ANSIBLE_ALLOW_BROKEN_CONDITIONALS=true` escape hatch,
  which this round's harness had omitted - a "divergence" that turned
  out to be a missing env var, not an engine bug (and retroactively
  explains round 163's own `geerlingguy.jenkins` finding the same way).
  `crystal spec`: 1581 examples, 0 failures.
- **`0.9.520`/`0.9.521`** - a user-requested regression check (round
  163: 20 roles resampled at random from ones already verified clean,
  across authors/distros) found 2 real gaps introduced or exposed by
  the previous 5 fixes: `ansible_version` (real Ansible magic var) was
  entirely unimplemented, surfaced by 0.9.517's own strict-undefined
  fix; `SSHManager`'s hardcoded 300s per-command SSH timeout was too
  short for legitimately slow real-world tasks (a source compile
  measured at 1536s against real ansible-playbook), raised to 1 hour -
  this also retroactively explained 2 earlier incidents mis-diagnosed
  as one-off cloud flakiness. Zero unexplained regressions across the
  other 18 roles sampled. `crystal spec`: 1580 examples, 0 failures.
- **`0.9.518`/`0.9.519`** - 2 real bugs found benchmarking 20 more
  previously-untested `robertdebock.*` roles on Rocky Linux 9.6 (round
  162): real ansible-core's `ansible.builtin.include:` action was
  removed entirely after 2023-05-16 and real ansible-playbook refuses to
  even start a run using it (`rc=1`, zero tasks) - this engine treated
  it as merely "not yet implemented" and skipped just that one task,
  continuing to run (and eventually fail differently for an unrelated
  reason) (`awx`); the `file:` module silently skipped the chown
  entirely when `owner:`/`group:` named a system user/group that
  doesn't exist yet, instead of failing the task the way real Ansible's
  own "chown failed: failed to look up user/group" does - a directory
  got silently created `root:root` instead of the intended owner, and
  the role continued as if nothing were wrong (`openbao_agent`). Both
  fixed and live-reverified byte-identical against real ansible-
  playbook 2.19.4. 13 of the 20 roles hit external/environmental
  blockers identical on both engines (missing repo packages, dead
  pinned download URLs, no python2/pip3 on Rocky 9), not engine bugs;
  one flagged anomaly (`luks` - a 300s SSH timeout installing a trivial
  package on one host) did NOT reproduce on an independent single-host
  re-test, confirmed as one-off cloud-provider flakiness. `crystal
  spec`: 1578 examples, 0 failures.
- **`0.9.517`** - fixed a real, pervasive architectural gap found in round
  161's own `robertdebock.bios_update` result (below): real Ansible's
  module-arg templating is strict-undefined by default - a `debug: msg:`
  (including inside a `rescue:` block) referencing a genuinely undefined
  variable fails the task; this engine instead rendered the literal text
  `"undefined"` and continued. `VarSubstitutor#substitute` gained a
  `strict:` parameter, used only at module-arg finalization, that raises
  for a BARE variable reference (`foo`/`foo.bar`/`foo['bar']` - no
  filters/operators) resolving to nothing - deliberately narrow, so an
  evaluator syntax-coverage gap elsewhere can't masquerade as a spurious
  task failure; `when:`/filter-chain expressions/Crinja block tags stay
  fully lenient by design (see `KNOWN_MISSING.md`). Surfaced and fixed a
  dependency bug along the way: `shell:`/`command:`'s check-mode-skip
  result was missing `stdout`/`stderr`/`rc`/etc. entirely instead of
  populating them empty/zero/null the way real Ansible's own check-mode
  skip does - verified live against ansible-core 2.19.4. `crystal spec`:
  1573 examples, 0 failures.
- **`0.9.515`/`0.9.516`** - 2 real bugs found benchmarking 20 previously-
  untested `robertdebock.*` roles on Rocky Linux 9.6 (round 161):
  `changed_when:`/`failed_when:` never enforced real Ansible's
  strict-boolean requirement for those two keywords specifically (unlike
  `when:`, which correctly truthy-converts) - a bare filter chain like
  `xz_version.stdout | regex_search("5\.6\.(0|1)")` returning `None` (no
  match) silently passed instead of failing the task the way real
  Ansible does (`cve_2024_3094`); `include_vars:` + `with_first_found:`
  with no matching candidate and no `skip: true` always silently
  skipped, when real Ansible's `first_found` lookup defaults `skip:` to
  false and RAISES (`release` - the role's own OS-specific vars file
  genuinely doesn't exist for Rocky 9, and real Ansible correctly fails
  loading it while crystal silently continued with no package list at
  all). Both fixed and live-reverified; 13 of the 20 roles hit external/
  environmental blockers identical on both engines (missing repo
  packages, 404'd pinned download URLs, GitLab-omnibus resource
  flakiness), not engine bugs. One real architectural gap found and
  documented but NOT fixed (`bios_update` - undefined-variable rendering
  is lenient everywhere in this engine vs. real Ansible's strict-by-
  default Jinja2, see `KNOWN_MISSING.md`). `crystal spec`: 1566
  examples, 0 failures.
- **`0.9.514`** - 2 more real bugs found benchmarking 10 more roles
  (linux-system-roles.* plus mixed authors, round 160, Rocky 9.6):
  `service_facts:` (backing `ansible_facts.services`) split each
  `systemctl` output line WITHOUT stripping leading indentation first,
  producing a leading empty-string element that shifted every column
  one field early - service state came back `"stopped"` for EVERY
  service on the host regardless of reality, breaking
  `linux-system-roles.network`'s own NetworkManager-vs-initscripts
  provider autodetection (it always fell back to `initscripts`,
  installing packages Rocky 9 doesn't have); `defaults/main/` and
  `vars/main/` as a DIRECTORY of files (the same convention
  `tasks/main/` already supported) was never read at all - only a
  single `defaults/main.yml` was ever looked for - so a role using the
  directory form (`kyl191.openvpn`) got none of its own defaults,
  tripping a validation check real Ansible never reaches. Both fixed
  and live-reverified. `crystal spec`: 1560 examples, 0 failures.
