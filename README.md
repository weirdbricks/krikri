## 📋 Project Overview

Crystal Ansible parses and executes standard Ansible playbook YAML directly,
without Python or the real `ansible-core` installed anywhere - it's a single
compiled binary plus a directory of plugin binaries. It supports:

- **Ansible-syntax playbooks** - roles, imports/includes, blocks, loops,
  handlers, vault, `become:`, Jinja2 templating - not just a handful of
  modules bolted onto a task runner
- **59 built-in plugins** covering package/service/file management, users
  and groups, Docker, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, firewalls, archives,
  SELinux/PAM, and more (see below)
- **Single binary deployment** - no dependencies, no Python required on
  either the controller or the target
- **Verified compatibility, not assumed compatibility** - every plugin's
  behavior is checked against real `ansible-playbook` output, and a
  Docker-based compatibility harness (`compat/`) runs the same playbooks
  through both engines side by side and diffs the resulting state

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full, continuously-updated tracking of
what's implemented, what's a documented scope cut, and why.

## ✨ Features

### Core Engine
- ✅ YAML playbook parser (Ansible syntax): plays, tasks, handlers, `vars:`
- ✅ Inventory: static INI + YAML, and dynamic (script-based) inventory
- ✅ SSH connection pooling, plus local (`ansible_connection: local`) execution
- ✅ Variable substitution `{{ vars }}` with a Jinja2 filter pipeline
  (chained filters, e.g. `{{ x | sort | join(',') }}`)
- ✅ Conditionals `when:` (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `in`,
  dotted attribute access), including magic variables such as
  `inventory_hostname` in *bare* (non-`{{ }}`) conditions
- ✅ Facts gathering (90+ `ansible_*` variables), with
  `--gathering implicit|explicit|smart` and `meta: clear_facts`
- ✅ Roles (`roles/<name>/{tasks,handlers,vars,files,templates,defaults}`)
- ✅ `import_playbook` / `import_tasks` / `include_tasks` / `include_role`
- ✅ `block:` / `rescue:` / `always:` error handling
- ✅ Loops: `loop`/`with_items`, `with_dict`, `with_nested`,
  `with_sequence`, `with_indexed_items`, `with_fileglob`
- ✅ `until:` / `retries:` / `delay:` retry loops
- ✅ `async:` / `poll:` fire-and-forget/background task execution
- ✅ Handlers (`notify:`/`listen:`)
- ✅ `become:` / `become_user:` privilege escalation
- ✅ Ansible Vault: AES256 encrypt/decrypt, `--ask-vault-pass`,
  `--vault-password-file`
- ✅ `--check` (dry-run) and `--diff` (show file changes) modes
- ✅ `--tags` and `--limit` host/task filtering
- ✅ Task batching - consecutive independent tasks bound for the same
  remote host run in a single SSH round trip instead of one round trip
  per task, on by default (`--no-batching` to disable; see the
  Performance section below and `ROADMAP.md`'s `0.9.61`-`0.9.63` entries)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Crystal (tested with 1.20.x - see `shard.yml` for the declared minimum)
  ([install guide](https://crystal-lang.org/install/))
- The `ssh` CLI on `PATH` for remote targets (SSH connections use native
  `ssh`/`ControlMaster` under the hood, not a bundled library)

### Build & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
shards install

# Build (all plugins + the CLI)
./build.sh

# Run a playbook
./bin/crystal-ansible playbook.yml

# With options
./bin/crystal-ansible --check --diff -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

## 💡 Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Deploy app
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      notify: reload nginx

  handlers:
    - name: reload nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: reloaded
```

Supports standard Ansible playbook syntax. See the
[Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) for playbook reference.

## 🎯 Command Reference

```bash
# Basic usage
./bin/crystal-ansible playbook.yml

# With inventory
./bin/crystal-ansible -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Dry-run (check mode)
./bin/crystal-ansible --check playbook.yml

# Show changes
./bin/crystal-ansible --diff playbook.yml

# Verbose output
./bin/crystal-ansible -v playbook.yml

# Limit to a host group/pattern, run only tagged tasks
./bin/crystal-ansible -l webservers -t deploy playbook.yml

# Vault-encrypted playbook/vars
./bin/crystal-ansible --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml
./bin/crystal-ansible --vault-password-file pass.txt playbook.yml

# Disable task batching (on by default - see Performance below)
./bin/crystal-ansible --no-batching -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Run each task against up to 10 hosts concurrently (default: 5, matching
# ansible-playbook; --forks 1 restores one-host-at-a-time)
./bin/crystal-ansible --forks 10 -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Fact gathering policy (default: implicit, matching ansible-playbook):
#   implicit - every play re-gathers
#   explicit - only plays that set gather_facts: true
#   smart    - each host gathered at most once per run
# Under smart, add `meta: clear_facts` to a play (e.g. after a reboot or a
# package install) to force the next play to gather again.
./bin/crystal-ansible --gathering smart -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

# Multiple options
./bin/crystal-ansible --check --diff -i production.ini playbook.yml
```

## ⚡ Performance

Measured against real `ansible-playbook`, not assumed - see `ROADMAP.md`
for the full, continuously-updated methodology and results.

### vs. real Ansible, end to end

3 fresh Atlantic.net instances per row (Ubuntu 22.04, all destroyed
immediately after each run), the same 12-task mixed playbook (`file`,
`copy`+loop x10, `lineinfile`+loop x10, `shell`+`register`,
`changed_when`/`failed_when`, `stat`, `assert`, `find`, `debug`) run
against both tools:

| | Fresh run | Idempotent re-run (median of 3) |
|---|---|---|
| Python `ansible-core` 2.19.4 (`forks=5` default) | 33.5s | 30.3s |
| `crystal-ansible` `--forks 1` (one-host-at-a-time) | 26.6s (1.26x) | 5.4s (5.6x) |
| `crystal-ansible` `--forks 3` | 27.5s (1.22x) | **2.9s (10.4x)** |

> These two rows were measured at `0.9.77`/`0.9.78` and have **not** been
> re-run since against later engine-level performance work - see
> `ROADMAP.md` for what's changed since. Rather than scale the old
> numbers by later isolated-benchmark ratios, they are left exactly as
> measured until the whole comparison is re-run against both tools on the
> same hosts.

Fresh-run time stays close across all three rows - that time is
dominated by the actual work (writing files, running commands), which
is identical regardless of orchestrator or fork count. The idempotent
case is where native compiled modules plus batched, forked SSH round
trips show through cleanly: Python ships and starts a fresh interpreter
per task per host even when nothing needs to change, while
`crystal-ansible` finishes in under 3 seconds. Idempotent reruns are
also the more common real-world case for a config-management tool.

`--forks` defaults to `5` since `0.9.78`, matching real
`ansible-playbook`'s own default - the two rows above measured `--forks 1`
and `--forks 3` explicitly, before that default flip. Pass `--forks 1` to
restore the original one-host-at-a-time behavior.

## ✅ Testing

```bash
# Unit + integration specs (crystal spec's own test runner)
crystal spec

# Ansible compatibility harness - runs the same playbooks through real
# ansible-playbook and crystal-ansible side by side and diffs the result
crystal run compat/run.cr
```

See [compat/README.md](compat/README.md) for what the compatibility
harness covers and how it works.

## 🚧 Limitations

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the live, detailed tracking of what is
implemented, what is not, and what is planned next.

**No known cross-cutting engine gap is currently open.** These get found
and closed on an ongoing basis via real-host benchmark rounds against
production Ansible roles (dev-sec, konstruktoid, linux-system-roles) -
see `ROADMAP.md` for the full, continuously-updated log of what's been
found and fixed, most recently a batch of plain-`{{ }}`-evaluator gaps
(depth-unaware operator parsing, dict/array literals outside a `+`
operand, a missing `d()` filter alias, block-level `vars:` never parsed,
among others) through `0.9.171`.

The remaining open items are narrow, documented scope cuts:

- **`meta:`** supports only `clear_facts`.
  `end_play`/`flush_handlers`/`refresh_inventory` and friends act on
  execution-flow machinery this engine models differently, and are
  rejected at parse time rather than silently ignored.
- **`docker_*` `api_version:`** is deliberately not planned - the
  underlying `docr` client uses unversioned endpoint URLs throughout, so
  pinning a version means touching every endpoint in a separate shard.
  The unversioned URLs negotiate fine against current Docker and Podman.
- **Cloud plugins** (`ec2`, `s3_bucket`, `azure_rm_*`) and inventory
  *plugins* (`aws_ec2.yml` et al.) remain explicitly lowest-ROI and are
  not planned.
- **Role-private custom modules** (a role's own `library/*.py`, outside
  the `ansible.builtin`/`community.*`/etc. plugin set this engine ships)
  aren't executed - there's no generic arbitrary-Python-module runner.
  A task using one is skipped with a "Plugin not available" warning
  rather than crashing the run; anything downstream that depends on its
  result sees that value as undefined, which can cascade into broader
  task-status divergence from real Ansible for roles that lean on this
  (seen repeatedly benchmarking linux-system-roles - `sr_fingerprint`,
  `timesync_provider`, `kernel_settings_get_config`, `blivet`).

`postgresql_privs`, which this roadmap tracked scope cuts against for a
long time, is complete as of `0.9.84` - every `type:` real Ansible's
module supports is implemented, including `function`/`procedure` and
`default_privs`.
