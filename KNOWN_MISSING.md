# Known Missing / Known Gaps

The goal is 100% behavioral compatibility with `ansible-playbook`,
verified against real runs rather than assumed - not "cover the common
cases." This file tracks what's actually missing **today**. It does
**not** carry implementation history or root-cause narrative for fixed
bugs - that lives in `git log` commit messages; search there (e.g.
`git log --all --grep=auth_socket`) rather than in a second, easily-
stale copy here. When an item below gets fixed, delete its bullet
instead of leaving a "fixed in 0.9.x" note - the commit that fixes it
is the record.

**Currently at `0.9.487`.**

## Real gaps (worth revisiting)

- **Task-level `vars:` are evaluated eagerly, not lazily like real
  Ansible's own per-key Jinja templating** - `build_vars_context`
  renders a task's whole `vars:` block unconditionally as part of
  building the context `when:` itself gets evaluated against, so a
  `vars:` expression that would legitimately raise (e.g. `| first` on a
  genuinely empty sequence with no `| default(...)` after it, or one
  the pipe order can't protect) crashes the task outright even when
  `when:` would have skipped it before real Ansible ever touched that
  expression. Same underlying class as the deferred `mount_options`
  divergence documented in `ROLES_TESTED.md`'s `robertdebock.
  mount_options` entry (round 140) - found again, independently, via
  `devsec.hardening.os_hardening`'s own mount-hardening task: `vars:
  mountinfo: "{{ ansible_facts.mounts | selectattr(...) | list | first |
  default(None) }}"` crashes on any host missing that particular mount
  point (e.g. no separate `/boot` partition - the common case on a cloud
  VM), even though `when: mount.enabled | bool` is `false` by the role's
  own default for that entry and real Ansible's lazy templating never
  evaluates `mountinfo` at all in that case. 6 of the role's 9 default
  mount entries (`home`/`tmp`/`var`/`var_log`/`var_log_audit`/`var_tmp`,
  alongside `boot`) are disabled-by-default and share the same shape, so
  this isn't narrow to one mount point. A real fix needs per-key lazy
  `vars:` evaluation (or at minimum, evaluating `vars:` only for the
  keys `when:`/the module's own params actually reference) - a
  genuinely bigger, riskier change to `build_vars_context`'s sequencing
  than a filter-level patch, given this project's own history of the
  vars-context-visibility bug class being the dominant source of real
  regressions. Not attempted narrowly: a same-session attempt at making
  `first`/`last` return an Undefined sentinel instead of raising (so a
  following `| default(...)` could catch it) broke the deliberately
  distinct case of `| first` with NO `default()` following, which must
  still raise (a real, spec-verified requirement - see
  `crinja_renderer_spec.cr`) - reverted rather than landed half-right.

Note: 0.9.474's entry here claiming `openssl_dhparam:`/
`openssh_keypair:` had "no plugin, no `AVAILABLE_PLUGINS` entry" was
itself wrong; both had been implemented, if more simply, since
`0.9.121`/`0.9.125`. 0.9.475 upgraded both to more fully match their
real modules regardless - see `git log`.

## Explicit scope cuts (not gaps to fix - documented so they aren't re-litigated)

- Cloud provider modules (`amazon.aws`/`community.aws` - `ec2_instance`,
  `s3_object`, IAM, security groups, etc.), `azure_rm_*`, and dynamic
  cloud inventory *plugins* (`aws_ec2.yml` et al.) - not implemented,
  not planned. These are a fundamentally different kind of module (HTTP
  calls to a cloud API from the controller, needing real request
  signing/auth, not shell commands run on a managed target) - a real
  API client built from scratch, not "another module that shells out to
  a CLI tool" like everything implemented so far. Revisit only if a
  specific real-world need justifies the investment.
- Role-private custom modules (a role's own `library/*.py`, outside the
  `ansible.builtin`/`community.*`/etc. plugin set this engine ships as
  native binaries) - there's no generic arbitrary-Python-module runner,
  so these can't execute at all. The task is skipped with a
  parse-time warning ("Plugin not available: <name>") rather than
  crashing the run, but anything downstream depending on its result
  sees an undefined value, which can cascade into broader task-status
  divergence for roles that lean on this (seen repeatedly benchmarking
  `linux-system-roles`: `sr_fingerprint`, `timesync_provider`,
  `kernel_settings_get_config`, `blivet`).
- `docker_*`'s `api_version:` pin - not implemented, not planned. The
  underlying `docr` client uses unversioned endpoint URLs throughout,
  so pinning a version means touching every endpoint in a separate
  shard; the unversioned URLs negotiate fine against current
  Docker/Podman. Revisit only if a real playbook actually needs the
  pin.
- `meta:` narrowed further in `0.9.480`: now also supports
  `refresh_inventory` (0.9.479 added `end_host`/`end_play`/
  `clear_host_errors`/`noop`), each ported from real Ansible's own exact
  semantics (`ansible/plugins/strategy/__init__.py`'s `_execute_meta`)
  and live-verified, including the non-obvious ones - `end_play` and
  `clear_host_errors` are genuinely GLOBAL (affect every currently-
  active/every-failed host in the play respectively, even one that
  never itself executes the meta task, e.g. because its own `when:`
  skips that specific task), while `end_host` is per-host only;
  `clear_host_errors` exempts a host from later plays and from the
  run's own exit code, but does NOT resume execution for it in the
  CURRENT play; `refresh_inventory` re-reads a dynamic inventory
  script's output in place, but (real Ansible's own documented caveat,
  also verified live) does NOT add newly-discovered hosts to the
  CURRENT play's own host loop, only to a LATER play's. Implementing
  `end_host`/`end_play` also surfaced and fixed a real, previously
  latent bug: `when:` on any `meta:` task (including the pre-existing
  `clear_facts`/`flush_handlers`) was never evaluated at all - parsed
  and silently dropped - so a when:-gated meta task always ran
  unconditionally regardless of the condition. What's left
  unimplemented: `reset_connection`/`end_batch`/`end_role` still act on
  execution-flow machinery this engine models differently (persistent-
  connection control, `serial:` batching, and role-scoped early-return
  respectively), and are rejected at parse time rather than silently
  accepted and ignored.
- `config`/`inventory_hostnames` lookups - architecturally out of scope
  (would require modeling Ansible's own config-resolution/inventory
  internals, not just a data lookup).
- `win_*` filters - Windows-only, irrelevant to this project's targets.
- `community.crypto.x509_certificate` / real CA issuance - a full,
  correct X.509 CA implementation is out of scope for a single module;
  blocks `robertdebock.ca` specifically. Note (0.9.475): the sibling
  `dirless/x509-crystal` shard already does self-signed/CA-signed X.509
  cert generation (ECDSA/RSA) via direct `LibCrypto` bindings - the
  expensive part of this scope cut - so a future attempt at this module
  should start there rather than from scratch, though it's not a
  drop-in (still needs CSR-based issuance from arbitrary subject/SAN
  fields, `state=absent`, revocation, etc. that shard doesn't expose).
- `community.general.vdo` - unimplemented; untestable so far, no real
  role sets a non-empty `vdo_devices`.
- `gluster.gluster.gluster_volume` - unimplemented; causes a cosmetic
  parse-time task-drop vs. real Ansible's "skipping" recap line, not a
  runtime crash.
- `community.general.zypper_repository` - unimplemented; same cosmetic
  parse-time-drop class, no zypper/openSUSE host ever tested.
- `ansible.posix.firewalld` - narrowed considerably in `0.9.478`:
  `zone:` now defaults to the system default zone
  (`firewall-offline-cmd --get-default-zone`), and real Ansible's own
  `permanent`/`immediate`/`offline` validation logic is ported exactly
  (verified against `ansible/posix/plugins/modules/firewalld.py`'s own
  `main()`) rather than requiring `offline: true, permanent: true`
  explicitly. What's left unimplemented is now only the one combination
  real Ansible services over a live D-Bus connection that this plugin
  has no backend for: a genuinely running firewalld daemon (auto-
  detected via `firewall-cmd --state`, real Ansible's own detection
  equivalent) AND an `immediate:` runtime change actually requested (or
  defaulted - real Ansible silently forces `immediate: true` whenever
  neither `permanent:` nor `immediate:` is given). Every other
  combination - which is every combination likely on the containerized/
  no-init-system hosts this project's benchmark rounds target - is
  serviced via `firewall-offline-cmd`, matching real Ansible's own
  auto-fallback. Verified live in a real firewalld 2.3.1 container
  (`firewall-cmd`/`firewall-offline-cmd`), byte-identical `ok=5
  changed=2 failed=0 ignored=1` against real `ansible-playbook` across
  4 scenarios (permanent-only enable, idempotent rerun, defaulted zone,
  and the still-unimplemented bare-defaults-against-no-daemon case
  correctly failing with real Ansible's own exact error message on
  both).
